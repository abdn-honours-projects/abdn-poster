# Aberdeen Poster Temaplte

This is a Document Template for Posters for Honours Projects in Computing Science at the University of Aberdeen. 

This template is not prescriptive, that is, unlike the [written report template](https://github.com/abdn-honours-projects/abdn-thesis), **you are under no obligation to use this for your own poster**. 

You are free to express your creativity using whatever page making software you like, including PowerPoint, OmniGraffle, Adobe InDesign, etc. This template, however, should be a convenient way to transpose your LaTeX formulas and the figures you used in your report to a large format document that renders nice [vector graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics) for the end result. This template, without modifications to the header of the text file or the document class will generate an A0-sized PDF suitable for high-quality printing (subject to your using vector graphics in the figures).
